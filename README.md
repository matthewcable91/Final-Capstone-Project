# Final-Capstone-Project
This is a basic social media web application where users can post, make comments, and vote on each others' posts. 

I worked on this project with 4 other people. 2 worked on the Vue.js front end. I, along with two team mates, worked on the backend that enabled the site's functionality. This entailed a Java backend, using a Data Access Object model, making changes to a Postgres SQL database using Spring JDBC. 

At the beginning of the project, I worked on helping my team mates frame out and implement a solid DAO based design for the Java backend, while another of my team mates created the SQL tables. Near the end of the project, I mostly worked on implementing functionality requests from the front end team, to get them quickly up and running on the back end. 

We used a Trello board to allocate tasks and followed the Agile methodology of daily meetings to decide which tasks to prioritize. 

To run this program, you will need to have Java, Postgres SQL, and Vue.js installed. 

Thank you for having a look!
